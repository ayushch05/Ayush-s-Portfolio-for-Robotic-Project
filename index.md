# Ayush's Robotic Arm Smart Car
My project is a smart car with a fan and robotic arm. This project is a combination of the smart rover and the robotic arm. My robotic arm smart car also has a fan that turns on or off based on the temperature of a thermostate assembled on my smart car. My project also has infrared sensors and a thermostat, each for different functionalities. The infrared sensors are placed underneath the rover to detect ground surface within a 5-centimeter range by emitting light waves. The thermostat's function is to measure the room temperature, and based on a certain room temperature, the thermostat sends a signal to arduino controller board to either turn on or off the fan. This is what my rover consists of.

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone
My second milestone was completing my robotic arm and integrating it with my smart car.

# First Milestone
After assembling and setting up all the parts on my rover to create my base project, the first milestone I completed was getting my rover to follow the instructions of my arduino code in order to do basic actions like moving backward, moving forward, and turning towards one direction. I struggled to complete this milestone initially because my rover wouldnâ€™t follow the instructions of my arduino code.
- My problem was that when my rover instructed to move forward, it would rotate very fast in the counterclockwise or clockwise direction. 
- The arduino code was right, so I knew there was nothing wrong with the software part of my rover.
- Each TT motor has a black and red wires attached as a terminal for battery voltage. The voltage flows from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal
- I forgot that my motors are set in the opposite direction, so I also have to make the red and black wire terminals
- This is my arduino code:
```
  void loop() {
    moveForward();
    delay(2000);
    stopMove();
    delay(500);

    moveBackward();
    delay(2000);
    stopMove();
    delay(500);
}
void moveForward() {
    digitalWrite(in1, LOW);
    digitalWrite(in2, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(in3, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(in4, LOW);
}

void moveBackward() {
    digitalWrite(in1, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(in2, LOW);
    digitalWrite(in3, LOW);
    digitalWrite(in4, HIGH);
}
```

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
